## How to Run the Code
1. Open Google Colab in your browser.
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Load the file you want to run.
4. Select the runtime (use default runtime).
5. Select "Run All Cells."

## Features
1. Implementation of two Deep Learning models (DNN and CNN) with high accuracy for the Google Speech Command Dataset.
2. Pre-processing of the dataset in MFCC format.
3. Extensive experimentation with different layers and parameters (note: it may take a long time).
4. Identification of the final model with the best parameters, achieving the highest accuracy and minimum loss with CNN and DNN.
5. A comprehensive project report is provided with a full analysis.
